                            <p>The New Zealand sea lion, also known as the Hooker's sea lion, has a robust and muscular body covered in a thick, short fur ranging from pale gold to dark brown.

                            <p>New Zealand sea lions primarily inhabit the subantarctic islands, including the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island, where they favor sandy beaches and coastal forests for breeding. They are also found along the mainland coastlines of New Zealand, especially in the Otago Peninsula and Stewart Island. These sea lions often venture into nearby waters to feed.</p>

                            <p>The population of New Zealand sea lions has dramatically decreased over the years, primarily due to intensive hunting by Polynesian settlers and European sealers in the 19th century. In recent decades, their numbers have been further impacted by factors such as fishing bycatch, disease outbreaks, and environmental changes.</p>

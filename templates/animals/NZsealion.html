                            <p>The New Zealand sea lion, also known as the Hooker's sea lion, is a large marine mammal with a distinctive appearance. Adult males can reach lengths of up to 3 meters and weigh around 400-600 kilograms. They have a dark brown or grayish coat, with a thick neck and a prominent mane of coarse hair.</p>

                            <p>New Zealand sea lions primarily inhabit the subantarctic islands, including the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island, where they favor sandy beaches and coastal forests for breeding. They are also found along the mainland coastlines of New Zealand, especially in the Otago Peninsula and Stewart Island. These sea lions often venture into nearby waters to feed.</p>

                            <p>The Kea has a fascinating history. These parrots have been living in New Zealand for thousands of years and have adapted to the unique environment of the country. They are believed to have evolved from an ancestor that arrived in New Zealand millions of years ago.</p>

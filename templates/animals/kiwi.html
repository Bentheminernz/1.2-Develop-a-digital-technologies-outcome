                            <p>The kiwi bird has a unique appearance. It is a flightless bird with a round body covered in brown, hair-like feathers. It has a long, slender beak that curves downwards, which it uses to probe the ground in search of food. The kiwi also has small, vestigial wings that are hidden beneath its feathers.</p>

                            <p>The kiwi bird is native to New Zealand and is found in a variety of habitats. It can be found in forests, grasslands, and even mountains. Kiwis are adapted to live in diverse environments, from dense forests to open areas. They prefer areas with plenty of vegetation and cover, as they are ground-dwelling birds. Kiwis are also known to burrow in the ground, creating nests or dens for themselves.</p>

                            <p>The Kea is a parrot species native to New Zealand. It is known for its vibrant plumage, with a mix of green, orange, and brown feathers. The Kea has a large wingspan and a long, curved beak, which it uses to forage for food.</p>

                            <p>The Kea is primarily found in the alpine regions of the South Island of New Zealand. They inhabit forests, mountains, and subalpine areas. These intelligent birds have adapted to survive in harsh environments, including snowy and windy conditions.</p>

                            <p>The Kea has a fascinating history. These parrots have been living in New Zealand for thousands of years and have adapted to the unique environment of the country. They are believed to have evolved from an ancestor that arrived in New Zealand millions of years ago.</p>
